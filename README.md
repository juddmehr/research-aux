# mehr-research-aux
Various auxiliary research things that I don't know where to keep, but are nice to have available.

- plotting has plotting defaults
- TODO: put together plot layouts or recipes or whatever to make your life easier at some point.

- TODO: need to add latex abstract/intro templates and custom commands and such

- TODO: next time you have to set up a computer, put together a script for setting everything up.
