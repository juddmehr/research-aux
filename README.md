Various auxiliary research things that I don't know where to keep, but are nice to have available.

## Plotting

the plotting directory includes basic plot defaults I always use as well as several color schemes I've developed and plot sizing convenience functions.

There is also a python function I found that supposedly strips png backgrounds, but I haven't had much luck with it doing a good job.

## Paraview

The paraview directory includes scripts for generating perceptually uniform color maps using custom colors. included is one from BYU navy to a dark red that passes through white.  I used it in my first paper.

There is also a json file that contains custom materials that I used in my AVIATION 2024 student paper competition title slide animation.  Materials are added to the json file located in the contents/materials directory inside the Paraview application contents.

## LaTeX

The latex directory includes the template I give to undergraduates (it's just the AIAA latex template) and contains my personal templates/question guides for abstracts and introductions to papers.
